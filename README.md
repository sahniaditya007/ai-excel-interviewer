# AI Excel Interviewer

An interactive web app that generates unique Microsoft Excel interview questions, evaluates user answers with AI, and provides detailed feedback—all in real time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Question Generation:** AI creates new, non-generic Excel interview questions at three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Automated Evaluation:** User answers are scored for correctness, efficiency, and clarity using a rubric-based AI evaluator.
- **Quality Assurance:** Each question is validated for clarity, relevance, and uniqueness before being presented.
- **Detailed Feedback:** Users receive constructive, mini-lesson feedback and an overall assessment for each answer.
- **Session Tracking:** Interview progress and logs are maintained in the session.
